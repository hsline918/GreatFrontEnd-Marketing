Hi, thank you for visiting my git repo.  
I am a self learner👩‍💻 and want to be a front end engineer in the future.  
Please take a look at my code and give me some advise📝 if you have time!

Note: will keep uploading my solution as I finished

# Great Front End Project - Marketing

### Part 9. Pricing Section Tiers

### 9/12 minor adjustment needed:

1. 3xl: tier Most popular not height did not align to other tow.
   And feature blank part it is manually added.

2. Use group property Tailwind provided to deal with Most Popular styling.

3. Did not apply TypeScript & Vitest yet due to time constraint.
